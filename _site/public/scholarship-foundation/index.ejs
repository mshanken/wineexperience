		<p><br />Education has always been a primary goal of <em>Wine Spectator</em>. Proceeds from the Wine Experience, now in its 35th year, support the <em>Wine Spectator</em> Scholarship Foundation, which provides grants and scholarships to a wide variety of wine-related and culinary programs.</p>
	                          
      	<p>To date, more than $20 million has been raised. This extraordinary sum has been made possible by the generosity of vintners from around the world, who donate the wine for the Wine Experience Grand Tastings and seminars, as well as the thousands of wine lovers who attend the event each year.</p>
      
      	<p><em>Wine Spectator</em> is proud to be a contributor to the following programs, and others that advance the development of America's wine and hospitality industries.</p>
